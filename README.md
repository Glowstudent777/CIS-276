# CIS-276

This is a repository for my CIS-276 class. It will contain all of the projects and assignments that I complete for this class.

## Running the code

The code in this repository will be written mostly, if not all, in C++. You can run the code by following the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Terminal or Command Prompt

## C++

To run the C++ code, you will need to have a C++ compiler installed on your computer. You can use a compiler like g++ to compile the code.

Once you have a C++ compiler installed, you can compile and run the code by executing the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
g++ <filename>.cpp -o <filename>
./<filename>
```

Replace `<filename>` with the name of the C++ file you want to run.
